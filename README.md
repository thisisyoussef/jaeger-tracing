# Jaeger Tracing

Jaeger Tracing is a distributed tracing system that enables developers to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. It can be used for monitoring microservices-based architectures, and it provides visualizations of call flows between services. This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to integrate Jaeger Tracing in a Node.js application.

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple Node.js application demonstrating how to integrate Jaeger Tracing for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. Key technologies and tools used in this project, along with their relevance, are as follows:

- **Node.js**: As a server-side JavaScript runtime, Node.js provides an efficient and lightweight environment for building scalable and high-performance applications. In this project, Node.js serves as the foundation for the application logic.

- **Jaeger Tracing**: Jaeger Tracing is a distributed tracing system that helps monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. In this project, Jaeger Tracing is used to trace the requests between services and visualize the call flows.

- **Express**: Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js, providing a minimal and unopinionated framework for this project's server setup.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/jaeger-tracing.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd jaeger-tracing
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage Guide

1. Start the Jaeger Tracing server using Docker (make sure you have Docker installed):

```
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

2. Run the Node.js application:

```
npm start
```

3. Open the Jaeger Tracing UI in your browser: http://localhost:16686

## Features and Functionality

- Distributed tracing with Jaeger Tracing: Monitors and visualizes the call flows between services within the application.

- Node.js and Express-based server setup: Provides a scalable and high-performance foundation for the application.
