# Jaeger Tracing

This project demonstrates the implementation of distributed tracing using Jaeger in a Node.js application. Distributed tracing is a powerful tool for observing and analyzing the performance of your services, helping you to identify bottlenecks and optimize your application's efficiency.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a simple Node.js application that simulates multiple service calls using Jaeger tracer to record and visualize the flow of requests across services. The main files in the project are:

- `index.js`: The entry point of the application that contains the logic for simulating the service calls.
- `tracing.js`: The module responsible for initializing and configuring the Jaeger tracer.
- `package.json`: Contains the project's metadata and dependencies.

## Installation Instructions

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/jaeger-tracing.git
```

3. Change to the project directory:

```sh
cd jaeger-tracing
```

4. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

5. Start the application:

```sh
npm start
```

## Usage Guide

To visualize the traces, you need to have Jaeger installed and running on your system. For installation and configuration instructions, refer to the [official Jaeger documentation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.22/getting-started/).

Once Jaeger is up and running, you can start the application as described in the previous section. The application will generate and send traces to the Jaeger backend, which can be viewed in the Jaeger UI.

## Features and Functionality

This project demonstrates the following key features:

- Initializing a Jaeger Tracer in a Node.js application
- Using the Jaeger Tracer to create and manage spans for service calls
- Configuring the Tracer to report traces to the Jaeger backend system

By understanding how to implement these features in your applications, you can better leverage the benefits of distributed tracing and gain insights into your service performance.

## Technologies and Tools Used

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run server-side code.
- Jaeger: An open-source distributed tracing system that provides complete distributed context propagation, metric collection, and visualization.
- OpenTracing API: A vendor-neutral API for distributed tracing that allows you to instrument your application with different tracing backends, such as Jaeger.

These technologies and tools contribute to the project's functionality and performance by providing a robust, scalable, and efficient environment for implementing distributed tracing in Node.js applications.
