# Jaeger Tracing

## Project Overview

Jaeger Tracing is a distributed tracing system for Node.js applications, providing end-to-end monitoring and tracing for all components within the system. The project enables developers to debug and optimize their applications by detecting performance bottlenecks and issues more efficiently. It leverages the power of Jaeger, a popular open-source distributed tracing system, to bring the best-of-class tracing capabilities to Node.js developers.

## Installation Instructions

To install Jaeger Tracing, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/jaeger-tracing.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd jaeger-tracing
   ```

4. Install required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

Now, you have successfully installed Jaeger Tracing on your local machine.

## Usage Guide

To use Jaeger Tracing in your Node.js application, follow these steps:

1. Import and configure Jaeger Tracing in your application:

   ```javascript
   const { initTracer } = require('./tracing');
   const tracer = initTracer('your-service-name');
   ```

2. Use the tracer object to create spans, context, and inject tracing into your services:

   ```javascript
   // Create a root span
   const span = tracer.startSpan('operation-name');
   // Add additional metadata to the span
   span.setTag('key', 'value');
   // Finish the span
   span.finish();
   ```

3. To propagate tracing between services, use the built-in inject and extract methods:

   ```javascript
   // Inject the span context into a carrier object (e.g., HTTP headers)
   const carrier = {};
   tracer.inject(span.context(), 'http_headers', carrier);

   // Extract the span context from the carrier object in the receiving service
   const extractedContext = tracer.extract('http_headers', carrier);
   ```

4. Run your application and observe the traces generated by Jaeger Tracing.

## Features and Functionality

- Distributed tracing across multiple services and components
- Customizable operation names and spans
- Metadata and baggage support for spans
- Context propagation for inter-service communication
- Integration with Jaeger backend for trace collection and analysis

## Technologies and Tools

Jaeger Tracing uses the following technologies and tools to deliver its functionality, performance, and overall success:

- **Node.js**: The primary language and runtime for the project, providing an efficient and scalable platform for building distributed applications and services.
- **Jaeger**: A powerful, open-source distributed tracing system that enables end-to-end tracing and monitoring of complex applications.
- **OpenTracing**: A vendor-neutral API for distributed tracing, providing a consistent and unified interface for tracing systems like Jaeger.
- **NPM**: The package manager for Node.js, used for managing dependencies and scripts for the project.

These technologies and tools, in conjunction, allow Jaeger Tracing to deliver high-quality distributed tracing capabilities to Node.js developers, making it easier for them to monitor, debug, and optimize their applications.
